This program is a simple "travel tracker" that allows a user to track places they wish to visit and places they have 
already visited. The program reads and writes a list of places in a text file, and each place has:

- name, country, priority, whether it is visited (v) or unvisited (n).

Users can choose to see the list of places, including the total number of places and
unvisited places.
